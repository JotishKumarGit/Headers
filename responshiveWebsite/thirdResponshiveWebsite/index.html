                <p class="sectionSubtag">Some text editors are small and simple, while others offer broad and complex
                    functions. For example, Unix and Unix-like operating systems have the pico editor (or a variant),
                    but many also include the vi and Emacs editors. Microsoft Windows systems come with the simple
                    Notepad, though many people—especially programmers—prefer other editors with more features. Under
                    Apple Macintosh's classic Mac OS there was the native TeachText later replaced by SimpleText in
                    1994, which was replaced in Mac OS X by TextEdit, which combines features of a text editor with
                    those typical of a word processor such as rulers, margins and multiple font selection. These
                    features are not available simultaneously, but must be switched by user command, or through the
                    program automatically determining the file type..</p>

                <p class="sectionSubtag">A text editor is a type of computer program that edits plain text. Such
                    programs are sometimes known as "notepad" software (e.g. Windows Notepad).[1][2][3] Text editors are
                    provided with operating systems and software development packages, and can be used to change files
                    such as configuration files, documentation files and programming language source code.[4]There are
                    important differences between plain text (created and edited by text editors) and rich text (such as
                    that created by word processors or desktop publishing software).

                <p class="sectionSubtag">Sustainable development is an organizing principle that aims to meet human
                    development goals while also enabling natural systems to provide necessary natural resources and
                    ecosystem services to humans.[2] The desired result is a society where living conditions and
                    resources meet human needs without undermining the planetary integrity and stability of the natural
                    system.[3][4] Sustainable development tries to find a balance between economic development,
                    environmental protection, and social well-being. The Brundtland Report in 1987 defined sustainable
                    development as "development that meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the
                    ability of future generations to meet their own needs".</p>
